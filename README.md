# Tutor.jl

Simple and concise Julia tutorials. This project contains small exercises to get you used to writing Julia code. This includes running tests and also reading error messages in the REPL or by running the program.

## What is this about?

Heavily inspired from Rust's [rustlings], Tutor.jl teaches you how to write julia programs by fixing small broken programs along the way.

## Getting Started

You will need to have julia installed. You can get julia by downloading a recent release binary in https://julialang.org/downloads/. Platform specific instructions can be found in https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/. 

You can also try to install julia too by installing [juliaup]. Instructions for installing juliaup can be found in its [README](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#installation).

## Doing the exercises (WIP)

[rustlings]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
[juliaup]: https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup

# TODO

- [ ] use REPL std as seen in https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL
- [ ] add CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] add tests and CI
- [ ] Submit package to the General registry
